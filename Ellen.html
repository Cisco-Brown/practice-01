        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          Ellen Gould White (née Harmon; November 26, 1827 – July 16, 1915) was
          an American author and co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
          Along with other Adventist leaders such as Joseph Bates and her
          husband James White, she was instrumental within a small group of
          early Adventists who formed what became known as the Seventh-day
          Adventist Church. White is considered a leading figure in American
          vegetarian history. Smithsonian named her among the "100 Most
          Significant Americans of All Time".

        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          Mrs. White claimed to have received over 2,000 visions and dreams from
          God in public and private meetings throughout her life, which were
          witnessed by Adventist pioneers and the general public. She verbally
          described and published for public consumption the content of each
          vision. The Adventist pioneers viewed these experiences as the
          Biblical gift of prophecy as outlined in Revelation 12:17 and
          Revelation 19:10, which describe the testimony of Jesus as the "spirit
          of prophecy". Her Conflict of the Ages series of writings endeavor to
          showcase the hand of God in Biblical history and in church history.
          This cosmic conflict, referred to by Seventh-day Adventist theologians
          as the "Great Controversy theme", became foundational to the
          development of Seventh-day Adventist theology. Her book on successful
          Christian living, Steps to Christ, has been published in more than 140
          languages. The book Child Guidance, a compilation of her writings
          about child care, training and education, has been used as the
          foundation for the Seventh-day Adventist school system.

          White was considered a controversial figure by her critics, and much
          of the controversy centered on her reports of visionary experiences
          and on the use of other sources in her writings. Historian Randall
          Balmer has described White as "one of the more important and colorful
          figures in the history of American religion". Walter Martin described
          her as "one of the most fascinating and controversial personages ever
          to appear upon the horizon of religious history". Arthur L. White, her
          grandson and biographer, writes that Ellen G. White is the most
          translated female non-fiction author in the history of literature, as
          well as the most translated American non-fiction author of either
          gender. Her writings covered a broad range of subjects, including
          religion, social relationships, prophecy, publishing, nutrition,
          creationism, agriculture, theology, evangelism, Christian lifestyle,
          education, and health. She advocated vegetarianism. She promoted and
          has been instrumental in the establishment of schools and medical
          centers all over the world, with the most renowned being Andrews
          University in Michigan and the Loma Linda University and Medical
          Center in California.

          During her lifetime she wrote more than 5,000 periodical articles and
          40 books. As of 2019 more than 200 White titles are available in
          English, including compilations from her 100,000 pages of manuscript
          published by the Ellen G. White Estate, which are accessible at the
          Adventist Book Center. Her most notable books are Steps to Christ, The
          Desire of Ages and The Great Controversy.
