        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          Ellen’s parents descended from resourceful ancestors. They fought in
          earlier wars, beginning with King Philips’s War in 1675. Some were
          entrepreneurs. Ellen’s great-great-grandfather built a mill on the
          river at Scarboro, Maine, known as “Harmon’s Mill.”
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          <strong>Robert F. Harmon, Sr., (1786-1866)</strong> — A resourceful
          farmer and hatmaker, Ellen’s father was disfellowshipped in 1843 from
          his church for embracing the Millerite message.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          <strong>Eunice Gould Harmon (1787-1863)</strong> — Her mother had two
          sons and six daughters, of whom Ellen and her twin, Elizabeth, were
          the last. She was a school teacher prior to marriage; afterwards she
          was an industrious homemaker.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          <strong>Siblings</strong> — Four of the eight Harmon children became
          Seventh-day Adventists — Ellen, Mary, Sarah, and Robert. Her sister
          Caroline’s daughter Mary worked briefly as her literary assistant.
          Robert, Jr. died at 27 of tuberculosis in 1853.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          Both of Ellen White’s parents became Adventists in later life. Shortly
          before their father died (and after Ellen had visited her sisters once
          more) she wrote, “Although we were not practically agreed on all
          points of religious duty, yet our hearts were one.”
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          <strong>Ellen’s Marriage and Family</strong> Part romance and part
          practicality led her to marry James White in 1846. He called her his
          “crown of rejoicing” and she called him “the best man that ever trod
          in shoe leather.” The marriage also increased both of their
          usefulness. He would travel with her in the perilous winters of New
          England, leading out in religious meetings while she shared what God
          had shown her.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          Their marriage produced four children, only two of whom reached
          adulthood. Their first born, Henry Nichols (1847-1863), a happy young
          man, died of pneumonia at 16. James Edson (1849-1928) learned the
          printer’s trade from his father at 14. He became a popular writer and
          composer. His tenacious work for slaves in the southern states was
          unparalleled.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          Early in life, the managerial skills of William Clarence (1854-1937)
          were recognized; he was elected to a variety of heavy responsibilities
          in church leadership. After his father died, he became a traveling
          companion and trusted counselor to his mother. Soon after his mother
          died in 1915, he was appointed secretary of the Ellen G. White Estate,
          supervising its work for more than two decades. Until he died, he
          served on several important boards of institutions.
