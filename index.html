    <h1>Ellen G. White Biography</h1>
    <p>Ellen Gould White (née Harmon; November 26, 1827 – July 16, 1915) was an
      American author and co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Along
      with other Adventist leaders such as Joseph Bates and her husband James
      White, she was instrumental within a small group of early Adventists who
      formed what became known as the Seventh-day Adventist Church. White is
      considered a leading figure in American vegetarian history. Smithsonian
      named her among the "100 Most Significant Americans of All Time".</p>
    <p>Mrs. White claimed to have received over 2,000 visions and dreams from
      God in public and private meetings throughout her life, which were
      witnessed by Adventist pioneers and the general public. She verbally
      described and published for public consumption the content of each vision.
      The Adventist pioneers viewed these experiences as the Biblical gift of
      prophecy as outlined in Revelation 12:17 and Revelation 19:10, which
      describe the testimony of Jesus as the "spirit of prophecy". Her Conflict
      of the Ages series of writings endeavor to showcase the hand of God in
      Biblical history and in church history. This cosmic conflict, referred to
      by Seventh-day Adventist theologians as the "Great Controversy theme",
      became foundational to the development of Seventh-day Adventist theology.
      Her book on successful Christian living, Steps to Christ, has been
      published in more than 140 languages. The book Child Guidance, a
      compilation of her writings about child care, training and education, has
      been used as the foundation for the Seventh-day Adventist school system.</p>
    <p>White was considered a controversial figure by her critics, and much of
      the controversy centered on her reports of visionary experiences and on
      the use of other sources in her writings. Historian Randall Balmer has
      described White as "one of the more important and colorful figures in the
      history of American religion". Walter Martin described her as "one of the
      most fascinating and controversial personages ever to appear upon the
      horizon of religious history". Arthur L. White, her grandson and
      biographer, writes that Ellen G. White is the most translated female
      non-fiction author in the history of literature, as well as the most
      translated American non-fiction author of either gender. Her writings
      covered a broad range of subjects, including religion, social
      relationships, prophecy, publishing, nutrition, creationism, agriculture,
      theology, evangelism, Christian lifestyle, education, and health. She
      advocated vegetarianism. She promoted and has been instrumental in the
      establishment of schools and medical centers all over the world, with the
      most renowned being Andrews University in Michigan and the Loma Linda
      University and Medical Center in California.</p>
    <p>During her lifetime she wrote more than 5,000 periodical articles and 40
      books. As of 2019 more than 200 White titles are available in English,
      including compilations from her 100,000 pages of manuscript published by
      the Ellen G. White Estate, which are accessible at the Adventist Book
      Center. Her most notable books are Steps to Christ, The Desire of Ages and
      The Great Controversy.</p>
