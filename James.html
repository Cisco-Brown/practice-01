        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          James Springer White (August 4, 1821 – August 6, 1881), also known as
          Elder White, was a co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and
          husband of Ellen G. White. In 1849 he started the first Sabbatarian
          Adventist periodical entitled The Present Truth, in 1855 he relocated
          the fledgling center of the movement to Battle Creek, Michigan, and in
          1863 played a pivotal role in the formal organization of the
          denomination. He later played a major role in the development of the
          Adventist educational structure beginning in 1874 with the formation
          of Battle Creek College.

          James White was born on August 4, 1821, in the town of Palmyra, Maine.
          The fifth of nine children, James was a sickly child who suffered fits
          and seizures. Poor eyesight prevented him from obtaining much
          education and he was required to work on the family farm. At age 19
          his eyesight improved and he enrolled at a local academy. He earned a
          teaching certificate in the common branches and briefly taught at an
          elementary school. He was baptized into the Christian Connexion at age
          15. He learned of the Millerite message from his parents and after
          hearing powerful preaching at an advent camp meeting in Exeter, Maine,
          White decided to leave teaching and become a preacher. Consequently,
          he has ordained a minister of the Christian Connexion in 1843. White
          was a powerful preacher, and it is recorded that during the winter of
          1843, 1,000 people accepted the Millerite message owing to his
          preaching. At times, however, White was met with angry mobs who hurled
          snowballs at him.[1] During these early travels he met Ellen G. Harmon
          whom he married on August 30, 1846. James White and Ellen G. White had
          four boys, Henry Nichols (1847–1863), James Edson (1849–1928), William
          Clarence (1854–1937) and John Herbert (1860–1860).

          The paper which James White initially started, "The Present Truth",
          was combined with another periodical called the "Advent Review" in
          1850 to become the "Second Advent Review and Sabbath Herald", still
          published as the "Adventist Review" today.[3] This periodical became
          the main source of communication for the Sabbatarian Adventist
          movement regarding points of doctrine and organization. It also became
          a venue for James and Ellen White to quickly and efficiently share
          their views to like-minded believers. James White served as editor of
          the periodical until 1851 when he invited Uriah Smith to become
          editor. He played a senior role in the management of church
          publications as president of the Review and Herald Publishing
          Association. He also served on several occasions as president of the
          General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. (1865–1867; 1869–1871;
          1874–1880).

          In 1865 White suffered from a paralytic stroke. White eventually
          determined that he should retire from the ministry and live out his
          days gracefully. In 1880, G. I. Butler replaced him as General
          Conference president. During the summer of 1881, White came down with
          a fever and was taken to the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Despite the
          efforts of Dr. Kellogg, White died on August 6, 1881.
