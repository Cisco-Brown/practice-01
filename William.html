        <h1 style="text-align: center; padding: 5px 0">William C. White</h1>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          William Clarence "Willie" White (29 August 1854 – 1 October 1937)
          (often referred to as W. C. White) was a son of Ellen G. White and
          James Springer White, two of the founders of the Seventh-day Adventist
          Church. He became a well known Seventh-day Adventist minister and
          church leader. W.C.'s son Arthur L. White worked closely with him and
          succeeded his father as Secretary of the White Estate.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          William Clarence White was born in Rochester, New York, August 29,
          1854. He died at Battle Creek, Michigan, September 1, 1937. He was the
          third son of James and Ellen White and was better known as WC (and the
          intimate, Willie).<br />
          Willie grew up in Battle Creek and Greenville, Michigan. He attended
          public schools and for some time a school run by GH Bell in Battle
          Creek. He grew up in a home that was the center of the growth of the
          Seventh-day Adventist Church. He listened to discussions about the
          advancement of the church with growing interest and understanding. He
          was baptized in Greenville, Michigan, at the age of 12 years.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          His first recommendation for denominational work came when he was only
          20 years old in Oakland, where his father had begun to publish the
          Signs of the Times magazine. Willie's task was to move with a
          wheelbarrow paper, printing types, printed sheets and the final
          product because the print was made several blocks away from the
          office. His expedient was filled with other activities in the office,
          all providing a thorough training in the field of publications.<br />
          He was associated with his father in establishing the publisher
          Pacific Press Publishing Association. At the age of 21 years he
          reluctantly accepted the invitation to be chairman of the committee
          responsible for the project and at the end of one year presented a
          balance of $2000.00 U.S. dollars profit.

        <h3>William and Mary White</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          William married Mary Kelsey on February 11, 1876. <br />
          The leaders decided that William and Mary White should study German
          and French at Battle Creek College to go to Europe assist John N.
          Andrews in establishing the third denominational publisher. However,
          due to a shortage of leaders with administrative ability, William was
          appointed as a student member of the school committee and was called
          to the publisher in Battle Creek as deputy director and also director
          of the Western Health Reform Institute (Western Institute for Reform
          health).
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          William remained in Battle Creek until 1880, devoting his time to the
          interests of publishing, educational and medical, and taking active
          part in the development of the work of the Sabbath School. Thereafter,
          until the summer of 1885, he was involved in activities on the Pacific
          coast, especially in publishing. The establishment of Healdsburg
          College, the second Adventist educational institution, in the spring
          of 1882, was one of the highlights of his work. During part of this
          time, he also worked as director of the General Conference Sabbath
          Schools. He was ordained to the ministry by the General Conference in
          1883 and was chosen a member of the General Conference Committee, a
          position he held most of his life.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          In 1883 he was called to Europe to establish publishing houses in
          Switzerland and Norway and to advise and assist in all lines of work
          in Europe. His mother, Ellen G. White, was also invited to spend some
          time visiting the countries of Europe, and arrived in Switzerland in
          September 1885, in time to attend the European Missionary Council, and
          spent two years fulfilling the mission for which they were called.

        <h3>Assistant to his mother; father and wife dies</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          After the death of his father in August 1881, certain responsibilities
          to assist his mother in her travels and in the publication of her
          books fell on his shoulders.[2] In 1888, when Ole A. Olsen was elected
          General Conference president, William served as president until the
          return of Olsen from Europe, six months later. His wife, Mary White,
          contracted tuberculosis while serving their editorial activities in
          Switzerland and died in 1890, at the age of 33 years.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          During the 1890s, then up until the end of his mother's life in 1915,
          he was especially prominent as an influential minister in the
          Seventh-day Adventist Church.
